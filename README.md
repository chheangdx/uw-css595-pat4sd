## Privacy Assessment Tool For Synthethic Data (PAT4SD)

With the capability of generative AI to uphold both the confidentiality and statistical essence of source data, organizations are increasingly considering its adoption as a means to anonymize data before public release. The synthetic data generated through this approach can offer equivalent utility to researchers, yet it may also foster an illusory sense of privacy if the anonymization model falls short in safeguarding corner cases or handling misconfigurations. Our capstone project seeks to bridge this critical gap by developing a privacy assessment framework tailored to synthetic data. This framework aims to furnish organizations with a clearer understanding of the privacy vulnerabilities inherent in their synthetic data, allowing them to make informed decisions before releasing data to the public.
